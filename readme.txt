== Implementation ==

Click on the Flash media button above a post to upload and embed Flash media in your current post or page. When inserting a Flash object, the necessary shortcode is automatically inserted into the post editor. Additionally, you can manually create and edit swfobj shortcode. 

The following attributes are available for use in the swfobj shortcode. If an attribute is not included, the default value is used if available. Otherwise the attribute is simply not included in the embedded content. To modify attributes, go to the `Settings > SwfObj` page.

= Main Attributes =
* **src** *(required)* The URL of your swf
* **height** The height of your object. *Default is 400px.*

* **name** The name to use on the object.
* **class** The class name to use on the object.

* **express\_install\_swf** The swf to replace the object with if the viewer doesn't have the minimum Flash player installed.
* **getvars** GET variables to be appended to the .swf file in the src attribute.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the ___ embed option? How? =
All Flash embed tags are made available through the SwfObj plugin. Most are set using the identical option in the swfobj embed code. For example, to set wmode to transpart you would use the following shortcode:
[swfobj ... wmode="transparent"]
For more documentation, refer to the [plugin website](http://orangesplotch.com/swfobj/ "plugin webpage"). If you do come across an option that isn't currently supported, please let me know.

= Why isn't it working? I'm using WP 2.3 =
This plugin uses WordPress's shortcode API. A feature which was added to WordPress in version 2.5. All versions of WordPress prior to this release, unfortunately, are incompatible with this plugin. Sorry.
